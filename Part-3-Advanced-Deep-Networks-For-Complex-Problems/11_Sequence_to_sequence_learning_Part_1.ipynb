    "**Data Acquisition and Cleaning**\n",

    "We utilize a bilingual parallel corpus provided by *manythings.org*, which contains English sentences paired with their German translations. The data requires rigorous preprocessing to ensure the model can learn effectively:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Cleaning**: The raw data often contains metadata (e.g., attribution info like \"CC-BY 2.0\") that is irrelevant to the translation task and must be stripped. We also filter out lines with problematic Unicode characters (such as `\\xc2`) that can cause encoding errors in downstream TensorFlow operations.\n",
    "2.  **Special Tokens**: To enable the model to generate text efficiently, we explicitly add two special tokens to the German translations:\n",
    "    * `sos` (Start of Sentence): Marks the beginning of the translation.\n",
    "    * `eos` (End of Sentence): Marks the end of the translation.\n",
    "    These tokens serve as functional signals for the decoder during inference, telling it when to start generating text and when to stop.\n",
    "3.  **Sampling and Splitting**: To ensure the training completes in a reasonable time for this exercise, we sample a subset of 50,000 phrase pairs. These are strictly split into training (80%), validation (10%), and testing (10%) sets to monitor overfitting and evaluate generalization.\n",

    "Before modeling, we must understand the data distribution. We analyze the **vocabulary size** (number of unique words) and **sequence length** (number of words per sentence). This analysis helps us define the input dimension for our embedding layers and the padding length for our batches. The following code calculates the vocabulary size based on word frequency."
