    "### **13.1 Transformers**\n",
    "\n",
    "While sequence-to-sequence models like LSTMs and GRUs have been pivotal in NLP, they suffer from a significant bottleneck: sequential processing. They must process tokens one by one, which prevents parallelization and makes it difficult to retain information over long sequences. The **Transformer** architecture addresses this by discarding recurrence entirely and relying on the **Attention Mechanism** to process the entire sequence simultaneously. This allows the model to model dependencies between all words in a sentence, regardless of their distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Figure 13.1 How Transformer models are used to solve NLP problems](Figure 13.1 How Transformer models are used to solve NLP problems)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Revisiting the basic components of the Transformer**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Transformer adheres to the standard **Encoder-Decoder** paradigm, but with a specific internal structure for each:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Encoder**: Its role is to ingest the input sequence and generate a rich, contextualized latent representation. It consists of a stack of $N$ identical layers. Each layer has two main sub-layers:\n",
    "    1.  **Multi-Head Self-Attention**: This mechanism allows the model to associate each word with every other word in the sequence to understand context.\n",
    "    2.  **Fully Connected Feed-Forward Network**: A standard dense network applied to each position independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Decoder**: Its role is to generate the target sequence token by token. It also consists of a stack of $N$ layers, but each layer has three sub-layers:\n",
    "    1.  **Masked Self-Attention**: Ensures that the prediction for position $i$ can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than $i$ (preventing the model from \"seeing the future\").\n",
    "    2.  **Encoder-Decoder Attention**: This layer performs attention over the encoder's output, allowing the decoder to focus on relevant parts of the input sentence.\n",
    "    3.  **Fully Connected Feed-Forward Network**: Same as in the encoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Self-Attention Mechanism**:\n",
    "Self-attention is the engine of the Transformer. For every token in the sequence, the model learns three vectors via trainable weight matrices: a **Query ($q$)**, a **Key ($k$)**, and a **Value ($v$)**. The attention score between two words is calculated by the dot product of the Query and Key vectors. The final output is a weighted sum of the Value vectors:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h = softmax(\\frac{Q \\cdot K^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}}) \\cdot V$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The term $\\sqrt{d_k}$ acts as a scaling factor to prevent the dot products from growing too large, which would push the softmax function into regions with extremely small gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Embeddings in the Transformer**\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the Transformer processes tokens in parallel rather than sequentially, it has no inherent understanding of the order of words (unlike an RNN which processes $t_1$ before $t_2$). To restore this information, the Transformer adds specific positional information to the input embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Token Embeddings**: These are standard learned vector representations for each token in the vocabulary, capturing semantic meaning (similar to Word2Vec).\n",
    "2.  **Positional Embeddings**: These are vectors of the same dimension as token embeddings but contain information about the *position* of the token in the sequence. In the original paper, these are not learned but are generated using fixed sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\n",
    "    $$PE(pos, 2i) = sin(pos/10000^{2i/d_{model}})$$\n",
    "    $$PE(pos, 2i+1) = cos(pos/10000^{2i/d_{model}})$$\n",
    "    Here, $pos$ is the position and $i$ is the dimension. This allows the model to easily learn to attend by relative positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final input to the encoder is the element-wise sum of the Token Embeddings and the Positional Embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Figure 13.2 How positional embeddings change with the time step and the feature position](Figure 13.2 How positional embeddings change with the time step and the feature position)\n",
    "\n",
    "![Figure 13.3 The embeddings generated in a Transformer model and how the final embeddings are computed](Figure 13.3 The embeddings generated in a Transformer model and how the final embeddings are computed)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Residuals and normalization**\n",
    "\n",
    "Training very deep neural networks is difficult due to the vanishing gradient problem. The Transformer employs two key architectural features in every sub-layer to mitigate this and ensure training stability:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Residual Connections (Skip Connections)**: The input of a sub-layer is added to its output: $Output = x + Sublayer(x)$. This creates a direct path for gradients to flow backward through the network, preventing them from diminishing.\n",
    "* **Layer Normalization**: Unlike Batch Normalization, which normalizes across the batch dimension, Layer Normalization normalizes the inputs across the *feature* dimension for each sample independently. This is crucial for NLP tasks where sequence lengths vary and batch statistics can be unstable. The normalization is applied after the residual addition.\n",

    "### **13.2 Using pretrained BERT for spam classification**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Understanding BERT**\n",
    "\n",
    "**BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** represents a landmark shift in NLP known as the \"ImageNet moment.\" It is essentially the **Encoder** stack of the Transformer architecture, pretrained on massive amounts of unlabelled text. This pretraining allows BERT to learn deep, bidirectional representations of language that can be fine-tuned for specific downstream tasks with relatively small labeled datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Figure 13.6 The high-level architecture of BERT](Figure 13.6 The high-level architecture of BERT)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input Representation**:\n",
    "BERT requires specific formatting for its inputs:\n",
    "* **`[CLS]` Token**: A special classification token inserted at the beginning of every sequence. The final hidden state corresponding to this token is used as the aggregate sequence representation for classification tasks (e.g., spam detection).\n",
    "* **`[SEP]` Token**: A separator token used to distinguish between two sentences (e.g., for Question Answering or Next Sentence Prediction).\n",
    "* **Segment Embeddings**: In addition to token and positional embeddings, BERT uses segment embeddings to explicitly signal whether a token belongs to the first sentence (Sentence A) or the second (Sentence B).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pretraining Tasks**:\n",
    "BERT is trained on two self-supervised tasks simultaneously:\n",
    "1.  **Masked Language Modeling (MLM)**: 15% of the input tokens are randomly masked (replaced with a `[MASK]` token), and the model must predict the original token based on the context. This forces the model to learn bidirectional context.\n",
    "2.  **Next-Sentence Prediction (NSP)**: The model is fed pairs of sentences and must predict whether the second sentence actually follows the first in the original text. This helps the model understand relationships between sentences.\n",

    "The dataset contains SMS messages labeled as 'ham' or 'spam'. Since 'spam' is the minority class, we must handle the class imbalance to prevent the model from becoming biased. We use the `imbalanced-learn` library to perform undersampling.\n",
    "* **Test/Validation Sets**: Created via Random Undersampling to ensure balanced evaluation.\n",
